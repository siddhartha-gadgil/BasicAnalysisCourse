This course is a basic introduction to Analysis and related foundations of Mathematics, going beyond and deeper than the first year courses. We will follow Terence Tao's books Analysis I and (part of) Analysis II. However, the background assumed in those books is less than the first year courses at I.I.Sc., so some parts will be covered rapidly or the treatment in the course will be at a more sophisticated level.

A brief outline of material covered, and occasionally more detailed notes, will be posted in this blog.
