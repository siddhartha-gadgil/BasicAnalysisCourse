Let $\\{x_n\\}$ be a __bounded__ sequence. Recall that a _limit point_ of $\\{x_n\\}$ is the limit of some subsequence $\\{x_{n_k}\\}$ of $\\{x_n\\}$.

1. Show that if the sequence $\\{x_n\\}$ converges to $l\in\mathbb{R}$, every subsequence of $\\{x_n\\}$ also converges to $\mathbb{R}$.
2. Show that the following are equivalent.
  * __(a)__ $\\{x_n\\}$ is convergent.
  * __(b)__ $limsup\\ x_n = liminf\\ x_n$.
  * __(c)__ $\\{x_n\\}$ has a unique limit point.

3. Let $L$ be the  set of limit points of $\{x_n\}$. Show that $limsup\\ x_n = sup\\ L$ and $liminf\\ x_n = inf\\ L$.
